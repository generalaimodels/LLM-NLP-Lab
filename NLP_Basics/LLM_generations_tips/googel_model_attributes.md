## 2. `temperature: float | None = None`

### Definition
The `temperature` parameter controls the randomness or creativity of the model's output in language generation tasks. It is a hyperparameter applied during the softmax operation to scale the logits before sampling the next token.

### Mathematical Formulation
Given a set of logits $z = [z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n]$ for $n$ possible tokens, the probability distribution over tokens is computed using the softmax function, modified by temperature $T$:

$$ P(i) = \frac{\exp(z_i / T)}{\sum_{j=1}^n \exp(z_j / T)} $$

- $T > 1$: Increases randomness, making the distribution more uniform (more creative outputs).
- $T < 1$: Reduces randomness, making the distribution sharper (more deterministic outputs).
- $T = 1$: Default behavior, equivalent to standard softmax.

### Importance
- **Output Diversity**: Higher temperature values encourage diverse and creative responses, useful for tasks like storytelling or brainstorming.
- **Determinism**: Lower temperature values ensure more predictable and focused responses, ideal for tasks like factual question answering.
- **Task-Specific Tuning**: Temperature is a critical tuning parameter to balance creativity and accuracy.

### Practical Implications
- Example: For a factual QA system, set $T = 0.7$ to prioritize accuracy; for creative writing, set $T = 1.2$ to encourage diversity.
- Overly high $T$ may lead to incoherent outputs, while overly low $T$ may result in repetitive or overly conservative responses.

## 3. `top_p: float | None = None`

### Definition
The `top_p` parameter, also known as nucleus sampling, controls the diversity of the model's output by restricting sampling to a subset of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold $p$. It is an alternative to temperature sampling.

### Mathematical Formulation
Given the sorted probability distribution $P(i)$ over tokens, nucleus sampling selects the smallest subset of tokens $S$ such that:

$$ \sum_{i \in S} P(i) \geq p $$

Only tokens in $S$ are considered for sampling, and their probabilities are renormalized:

$$ P'(i) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{P(i)}{\sum_{j \in S} P(j)} & \text{if } i \in S \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

### Importance
- **Controlled Diversity**: Unlike temperature, which globally affects the distribution, `top_p` focuses on the most probable tokens, providing a more controlled form of diversity.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the risk of sampling low-probability tokens, which can lead to incoherent outputs.
- **Flexibility**: Works well in combination with temperature to fine-tune generation behavior.

### Practical Implications
- Example: Setting `top_p = 0.9` means sampling only from tokens that collectively account for 90% of the probability mass, ignoring low-probability tokens.
- Lower `top_p` values reduce diversity, while higher values increase it, but excessively high values may negate the benefits of nucleus sampling.

## 4. `top_k: float | None = None`

### Definition
The `top_k` parameter, also known as top-k sampling, restricts sampling to the $k$ most probable tokens at each generation step. It is another method to control output diversity.

### Mathematical Formulation
Given the sorted probability distribution $P(i)$ over tokens, top-k sampling selects the top $k$ tokens and renormalizes their probabilities:

$$ P'(i) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{P(i)}{\sum_{j \in \text{top-k}} P(j)} & \text{if } i \in \text{top-k} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

### Importance
- **Diversity Control**: Limits the model's choices to the most likely tokens, reducing the chance of generating low-quality or irrelevant outputs.
- **Simplicity**: Easier to interpret and tune compared to `top_p`, as it directly specifies the number of tokens to consider.
- **Task-Specific Tuning**: Useful for tasks requiring a balance between creativity and coherence.

### Practical Implications
- Example: Setting `top_k = 50` means sampling only from the 50 most probable tokens at each step.
