Mathematical Foundations\n","\n","### 3.1 Problem Formulation\n","In-context learning can be formalized as a conditional probability problem. Let:\n","\n","- $x_{\\text{prompt}}$: The input prompt, which may include task instructions (for ZS) or instructions plus examples (for FS).\n","- $x_{\\text{input}}$: The input for which the model must generate a prediction.\n","- $y$: The desired output (e.g., a classification label, generated text, etc.).\n","- $P(y|x_{\\text{prompt}}, x_{\\text{input}})$: The probability of generating the correct output $y$ given the prompt and input.\n","\n","The model's objective is to maximize this conditional probability without fine-tuning its parameters $\\theta$. Mathematically:\n","\n","$$\n","P(y|x_{\\text{prompt}}, x_{\\text{input}}; \\theta) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} P(y_t | y_{<t}, x_{\\text{prompt}}, x_{\\text{input}}; \\theta)\n","$$\n","\n","Here, $y_t$ represents the $t$-th token in the output sequence, and $y_{<t}$ represents all preceding tokens. The parameters $\\theta$ are fixed (pre-trained) and not updated during inference.\n","\n","### 3.2 Attention Mechanism in Transformers\n","The transformer architecture underpins in-context learning by using self-attention to weigh the importance of different tokens in the prompt and input. The attention mechanism can be expressed as:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n","$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $Q, K, V$: Query, key, and value matrices derived from the input embeddings.\n","- $d_k$: Dimensionality of the key vectors.\n","\n","In FS learning, the model attends to the examples in the prompt to identify patterns, while in ZS learning, it attends to the task description to infer the task.\n","\n","### 3.3 Prompt Engineering\n","Prompt engineering can be viewed as an optimization problem over the space of possible prompts. Let $P$ be the set of possible prompts, and $L(y, \\hat{y})$ be a loss function measuring the difference between the true output $y$ and the model's predicted output $\\hat{y}$. The goal is to find the optimal prompt $p^* \\in P$ that minimizes the expected loss:\n","\n","$$\n","p^* = \\arg \\min_{p \\in P} \\mathbb{E}_{x, y} [L(y, f(x, p; \\theta))]\n","$$\n","\n","Here, $f(x, p; \\theta)$ is the model's output given input $x$, prompt $p$, and fixed parameters $\\theta$.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Detailed Explanation of Concepts\n","\n","### 4.1 Zero-Shot Learning\n","In ZS learning, the model relies solely on its pre-trained knowledge and the task description. For example, to perform sentiment classification, the prompt might be:\n","\n","*\"Classify the sentiment of the following text as positive or negative: 'I loved the movie!'.\"*\n","\n","The model must:\n","1. Parse the instruction (\"classify the sentiment\").\n","2. Understand the concepts of \"positive\" and \"negative\" sentiment from its pre-training.\n","3. Analyze the input text to infer the sentiment.\n","\n","#### Challenges in ZS\n","- **Ambiguity**: Task descriptions may be unclear or insufficient, leading to incorrect predictions.\n","- **Lack of Examples**: Without examples, the model may struggle to generalize to tasks that differ significantly from its pre-training data.\n","\n","### 4.2 Few-Shot Learning\n","In FS learning, the model is provided with a few examples in the prompt to guide its predictions. For example:\n","\n","*\"Here are examples of sentiment classification: 'I hated the food' → negative, 'The service was amazing' → positive. Now classify: 'The ambiance was terrible'.\"*\n","\n","The model:\n","1. Identifies the pattern in the examples (e.g., negative words like \"hated\" and \"terrible\" map to \"negative\").\n","2. Applies this pattern to the new input.\n","\n","#### Advantages of FS over ZS\n","- **Improved Generalization**: Examples help disambiguate the task and improve performance, especially for complex or niche tasks.\n","- **Reduced Reliance on Instructions**: Examples can implicitly convey task details that are hard to express in instructions alone.\n","\n","### 4.3 Prompt Engineering\n","Prompt engineering is critical for both ZS and FS learning. Well-designed prompts can significantly improve model performance. Techniques include:\n","\n","- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: Encourages the model to \"think step by step\" by including reasoning steps in the prompt. For example, in a math problem, the prompt might include: *\"To solve 2 + 3, first add 2 and 1 to get 3, then add 2 more to get 5.\"*\n","- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex tasks into simpler subtasks within the prompt.\n","- **Example Selection**: In FS, choosing diverse and representative examples to maximize generalization.\n","\n","### 4.4 Limitations of In-Context Learning\n","While ZS and FS learning are powerful, they have inherent limitations:\n","\n","- **Context Window Constraints**: The model's context window (e.g., 2048 tokens) limits the amount of information that can be included in the prompt. This restricts the number of examples in FS or the complexity of instructions in ZS.\n","- **Complex Tasks**: Tasks requiring deep reasoning, long-term dependencies, or significant domain knowledge may perform poorly without fine-tuning, as in-context learning relies entirely on the model's pre-trained knowledge.\n","\n","### 4.5 Role of Gradient Steps\n","For complex tasks, gradient-based fine-tuning is often necessary to update the model's parameters $\\theta$. In contrast, ZS and FS learning keep $\\theta$ fixed, relying on prompt engineering to adapt the model's behavior. Fine-tuning, however, requires labeled data and computational resources, making ZS and FS more efficient in data-scarce scenarios.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5.
