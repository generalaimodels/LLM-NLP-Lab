## Definition of AI Agent

- **AI Agent**: An AI agent is an autonomous computational entity that perceives its environment through sensors, processes information, and acts upon the environment via actuators to achieve specific goals, often optimizing for a defined objective function.

## Pertinent Equations

- **Agent Function**:  
  $$ f: P^* \rightarrow A $$
  Where $P^*$ is the set of all possible percept sequences, and $A$ is the set of possible actions.

- **Rationality Criterion**:  
  $$ \text{Performance Measure} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} r_t $$
  Where $r_t$ is the reward at time $t$.

- **Policy Function**:  
  $$ \pi(a|s) = P(a|s) $$
  Where $\pi$ is the policy, $a$ is the action, and $s$ is the state.

## Key Principles

- **Autonomy**: Operates independently, making decisions without human intervention.
- **Perception**: Gathers data from the environment via sensors.
- **Reasoning**: Processes percepts to infer knowledge and make decisions.
- **Action**: Executes actions to influence the environment.
- **Learning**: Adapts behavior based on experience or feedback.

## Detailed Concept Analysis

### 1. **Why is AI Agent?**

- **Necessity**:  
  - Automates complex decision-making tasks.
  - Handles dynamic, uncertain, or partially observable environments.
  - Scales cognitive tasks beyond human capability.

- **Applications**:  
  - Robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants, recommendation systems, industrial automation, and more.

### 2. **What is AI Agent?**

- **Types**:
  - **Simple Reflex Agents**: Act only on current percept.
  - **Model-Based Agents**: Maintain internal state to handle partial observability.
  - **Goal-Based Agents**: Act to achieve explicit goals.

  - **Learning Agents**: Improve performance over time via learning.

- **Components**:
  - **Sensors**: Interface for perception.
  - **Actuators**: Interface for action.
  - **Agent Program**: Core logic for decision-making.

### 3. **When is AI Agent Required?**

- **Scenarios**:
  - Environments requiring real-time, adaptive decision-making.
  - Tasks with high complexity, scale, or speed beyond human capability.
  - Situations with incomplete, noisy, or ambiguous data.

## How to Implement AI Agent from Scratch

### 1. **Define the Environment**
   - Specify state space $S$, action space $A$, and percepts $P$.

### 2. **Design the Agent Architecture**
   - Choose agent type (reflex, model-based, goal-based, utility-based, learning).
   - Define sensors and actuators.

### 3. **Implement Perception Module**
   - Code to process raw sensor data into meaningful percepts.

### 4. **Develop Reasoning/Decision Module**
   - Implement agent function $f$ or policy $\pi$.
   - For learning agents, integrate learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, DQN).

### 5. **Action Module**
   - Map decisions to actuator commands.

### 6. **Feedback and Learning**
   - Integrate reward signals and update policy or value functions.

#### **Example: Simple Reflex Agent (Pseudocode)**
```python
def agent(percept):
    if percept == "obstacle":
        return "turn"
    else:
        return "move_forward"
```

#### **Example: Reinforcement Learning Agent (Q-Learning)**
$$ Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)] $$
