## 1. Definition  
An **AI agent** is a computational entity that  
- perceives its environment via sensors,  
- maintains internal state/knowledge,  
- selects and executes actions through actuators,  
- learns and adapts to maximize a formal objective (utility, reward, or goal satisfaction).  

## 2. Pertinent Equations  

| Concept | Formula | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Policy | $$\pi : \mathcal{H}\rightarrow \mathcal{A}$$ | Maps percept history $h_t\in\mathcal{H}$ to an action $a_t\in\mathcal{A}$. |
| Expected utility | $$\mathbb{E}_{h_t\sim P}\,[\,U(h_t)\mid\pi\,]$$ | Rational agent chooses $\pi^\*$ that maximizes expected utility $U$. |
| RL objective | $$J(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\pi_\theta}\Big[\sum_{t=0}^{T}\gamma^{t}r_t\Big]$$ | Parameterized policy $\pi_\theta$ optimized by gradient ascent: $$\nabla_\theta J(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{\tau}\big[\nabla_\theta\log\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)R_t\big]$$ |
| Value function | $$V^\pi(s)=\mathbb{E}_\pi\Big[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\gamma^{k}r_{t+k}\mid s_t=s\Big]$$ | Measures long-term desirability of state under $\pi$. |

## 3. Key Principles  
- Rationality (maximize expected performance).  
- Autonomy (minimal human intervention).  
- Perception-Action Loop (sense → think → act).  
- Learning (supervised, RL, self-supervised).  
- PEAS framework (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors).  
- Bounded optimality (optimize within computational limits).  
- Safety & alignment (constrain policies to human values).  

## 4. Detailed Concept Analysis  

### 4.1 Agent–Environment Loop  
```text
repeat
    percept  ← Observe(Environment)
    belief   ← UpdateState(percept, belief)
    goal     ← Deliberate(belief)
    action   ← Plan&Select(goal, belief)
    Execute(action)
until termination
```

### 4.2 Architectures  
- Reactive (e.g., Subsumption).  
- Deliberative (symbolic reasoning, planners).  
- Hybrid (layered, sense-plan-act).  
- BDI (Belief–Desire–Intention).  
- Learning-centric (deep RL, transformer agents).  

### 4.3 Environment Typology  
| Dimension | Variants |
|-----------|----------|
| Observability | fully vs. partially observable |
| Determinism | deterministic vs. stochastic |
| Dynamics | static vs. dynamic |
| Episodic | episodic vs. sequential |
| Agents | single- vs. multi-agent |

### 4.4 Lifecycle Phases  
1. Specification (task + PEAS).  
2. Modeling (state, action, transition, reward).  
3. Algorithm design (search, planning, RL).  
4. Implementation (code, simulators, real hardware).  
5. Evaluation (metrics, ablations, benchmarks).  
6. Deployment (monitoring, updates, safety checks).  

## 5. Importance & Use-Cases (Why & When Required)  
- Automation where continuous perception–action is essential (robotics, autonomous driving).  
- Complex, dynamic decision domains (finance, logistics, game AI).  
- Human-in-the-loop assistants (LLM-powered chat agents, scheduling bots).  
- Scientific discovery (lab automation, molecule design).  

AI agents are required when  
- environments change faster than manual coding can capture,  
- tasks demand long-horizon reasoning, adaptation, or autonomy,  
- safety or cost prohibits continuous human control.  

## 6. Implementation From Scratch  

### 6.1 Task Specification  
1. Define performance metric $M$.  
2. Formalize state space $\mathcal{S}$, action set $\mathcal{A}$, reward $r$.  

### 6.2 Choose Architecture  
- For low-latency reflexes → reactive.  
- For plan-heavy tasks → BDI or hybrid.  
- For high-dimensional perception → deep RL or transformer-based tool agent.  

### 6.3 Core Modules  
| Module | Function | Typical Tools |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Perception | $s_t = f(o_t)$ | CNNs, RNNs, ViT, ASR |
| State tracking | belief update | Bayesian filters, transformers |
| Decision | $\pi(a_t|s_t)$ | MCTS, A\*, PPO, SAC |
| Learning | optimize $\theta$ | gradient descent, evolutionary methods |
| Actuation | command hardware/API | ROS, web APIs |

### 6.4 Minimal Python Skeleton  
```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, policy, learner):
        self.policy  = policy   # πθ
        self.learner = learner  # optimizer
    def act(self, state):
        return self.policy(state)
    def learn(self, trajectory):
        loss = self.learner.update(self.policy, trajectory)
        return loss
env = Env()
agent = Agent(policy=PPO(...), learner=PPOTrainer(...))
state = env.reset()
while not done:
    action = agent.act(state)
    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    agent.learn((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
    state = next_state
```

### 6.5 Evaluation & Iteration  
- Offline metrics: $$\bar{R}, \text{SR}@N, \text{success\_rate}$$.  
- Online A/B tests, simulation-to-real transfer checks.  
- Safety validation: adversarial stress tests, formal verification.  

## 7. Pros vs Cons  

| Pros | Cons |

| Continuous autonomy, scalability | Safety/align risks |
| Fast reaction in dynamic worlds | Debugging opacity (black-box models) |
| Learning reduces manual rule cost | Data-hungry, compute-intensive |
| Handles partial observability | Potential security vulnerabilities |
| Enables emergent collaboration (multi-agent) | Regulatory, ethical, liability issues |
