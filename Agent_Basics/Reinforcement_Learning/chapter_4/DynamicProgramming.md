## 4.1 Policy Evaluation (Prediction)

### Definition
Policy evaluation computes the **state-value function** $V^\pi(s)$ for a given policy $\pi$, quantifying the expected return starting from state $s$ and following $\pi$ thereafter.

### Pertinent Equations
- **Bellman Expectation Equation for $V^\pi$**:
  $$
  V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ R_{t+1} + \gamma V^\pi(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s \right]
  $$
  Expanded:
  $$
  V^\pi(s) = \sum_{a} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s', r} p(s', r | s, a) \left[ r + \gamma V^\pi(s') \right]
  $$

### Key Principles
- **Iterative Policy Evaluation**: Repeatedly update $V(s)$ using the Bellman equation until convergence.
- **Convergence**: Guaranteed under standard conditions (finite MDP, $\gamma < 1$).

### Detailed Concept Analysis
- **Initialization**: $V_0(s)$ arbitrarily (often zero).
- **Update Rule**:
  $$
  V_{k+1}(s) \leftarrow \sum_{a} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s', r} p(s', r | s, a) \left[ r + \gamma V_k(s') \right]
  $$
- **Stopping Criterion**: $|V_{k+1}(s) - V_k(s)| < \theta$ for all $s$.

### Importance
- **Foundation for Policy Improvement**: Accurate $V^\pi$ is essential for evaluating and improving policies.
- **Prediction Task**: Central to understanding the long-term consequences of actions under a fixed policy.

### Pros vs. Cons
- **Pros**:
  - Guarantees convergence.
  - Provides exact values for tabular MDPs.
- **Cons**:
  - Computationally expensive for large state spaces.
  - Requires full knowledge of environment dynamics.

### Cutting-Edge Advances
- **Function Approximation**: Neural networks for $V^\pi$ in large/continuous spaces.
- **Batch/Parallel Evaluation**: Distributed computation for scalability.

## 4.2 Policy Improvement

### Definition
Policy improvement constructs a new policy $\pi'$ that is greedy with respect to the current value function $V^\pi$.

### Pertinent Equations
- **Greedy Policy**:
  $$
  \pi'(s) = \arg\max_{a} Q^\pi(s, a)
  $$
  where
  $$
  Q^\pi(s, a) = \mathbb{E} \left[ R_{t+1} + \gamma V^\pi(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s, A_t = a \right]
  $$

### Key Principles
- **Policy Improvement Theorem**: If $\pi'$ is greedy w.r.t. $V^\pi$, then $V^{\pi'}(s) \geq V^\pi(s)$ for all $s$.

### Detailed Concept Analysis
- **One-step Improvement**: For each $s$, select action maximizing expected return.
- **Iterative Process**: Repeated improvement leads to optimal policy.

### Importance

- **Guarantees Monotonic Improvement**: Each step is non-decreasing in value.

### Pros vs. Cons
- **Pros**:
  - Simple, effective improvement mechanism.
  - Theoretical guarantees.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires accurate $V^\pi$ or $Q^\pi$.
  - Computationally intensive for large action spaces.

### Cutting-Edge Advances
- **Soft/Entropy-Regularized Improvement**: Smooths policy updates, improves exploration.
- **Batch Policy Improvement**: Parallelizes action selection.

## 4.3 Policy Iteration

### Definition
Policy iteration alternates between **policy evaluation** and **policy improvement** until convergence to the optimal policy $\pi^*$.

### Pertinent Equations
- **Policy Evaluation**: As above.
- **Policy Improvement**: As above.

### Key Principles
- **Guaranteed Convergence**: Finite MDPs, $\gamma < 1$.
- **Two-Phase Algorithm**:
  1. Evaluate $V^\pi$.
  2. Improve $\pi$.

### Detailed Concept Analysis
- **Algorithm**:
  1. Initialize $\pi$ arbitrarily.
  2. Loop:
     - Evaluate $V^\pi$.
     - Improve $\pi$.
     - If $\pi$ unchanged, stop.

### Importance

## 4.4 Value Iteration

### Definition
Value iteration combines policy evaluation and improvement into a single update, iteratively applying the Bellman optimality operator.

### Pertinent Equations
- **Bellman Optimality Update**:
  $$
  V_{k+1}(s) \leftarrow \max_{a} \sum_{s', r} p(s', r | s, a) \left[ r + \gamma V_k(s') \right]
  $$

### Key Principles
- **Contraction Mapping**: Guarantees convergence to $V^*$.
- **Simultaneous Update**: No separate policy step.

### Detailed Concept Analysis
- **Algorithm**:
  1. Initialize $V_0(s)$.
  2. For each $k$, update $V_{k+1}(s)$ as above.
  3. Derive $\pi^*$ from $V^*$.

### Importance

  $$
  V(s) \leftarrow \max_{a} \sum_{s', r} p(s', r | s, a) \left[ r + \gamma V(s') \right]
  $$
  (applied to selected $s$ only)

### Key Principles
- **Flexibility**: Updates can be random, cyclic, or prioritized.
- **Partial Sweeps**: Allows for incremental computation.

### Detailed Concept Analysis

## 4.6 Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI)

### Definition
GPI refers to the general interplay between policy evaluation and improvement, not necessarily to full convergence in either step.

### Pertinent Equations
- **Interleaved Updates**:
  - Partial evaluation:
    $$
    V \leftarrow \text{PartialEval}(V, \pi)
    $$
  - Partial improvement:
    $$
    \pi \leftarrow \text{PartialImprove}(V)
    $$

### Key Principles

- **Unifying Framework**: Encompasses policy iteration, value iteration, and their variants.

### Detailed Concept Analysis
