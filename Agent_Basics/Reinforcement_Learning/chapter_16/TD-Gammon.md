# 16.1 TD-Gammon

## Definition

**TD-Gammon** is a pioneering reinforcement learning (RL) system developed by Gerald Tesauro in the early 1990s to play the game of backgammon at a superhuman level. It utilizes **temporal-difference (TD) learning** combined with a neural network function approximator to evaluate board positions and improve its policy through self-play.

## Pertinent Equations

- **TD(λ) Update Rule:**
  $$
  V(s_t) \leftarrow V(s_t) + \alpha \left[ G_t^{(\lambda)} - V(s_t) \right]
  $$
  where:
  - $ V(s_t) $: Value estimate of state $ s_t $
  - $ \alpha $: Learning rate
  - $ G_t^{(\lambda)} $: $\lambda$-return, a weighted sum of n-step returns

- **$\lambda$-Return:**
  $$
  G_t^{(\lambda)} = (1 - \lambda) \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \lambda^{n-1} G_t^{(n)}
  $$
  where $ G_t^{(n)} $ is the n-step return.

- **Neural Network Output:**
  $$
  V(s; \theta)
  $$
  where $ \theta $ are the neural network parameters.

- **Parameter Update (Gradient Descent):**
  $$
  \theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \delta_t \nabla_\theta V(s_t; \theta)
  $$
  where $ \delta_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma V(s_{t+1}; \theta) - V(s_t; \theta) $

## Key Principles

- **Temporal-Difference Learning:**  
  Combines ideas from Monte Carlo and dynamic programming. Learns directly from raw experience without a model of the environment.

- **Function Approximation:**  
  Uses a multi-layer neural network to generalize value estimates across similar board positions.

- **Self-Play:**  
  The agent improves by playing against itself, generating a diverse set of experiences.

- **Policy Improvement:**  
  The policy is implicitly improved as the value function becomes more accurate.

## Detailed Concept Analysis

- **State Representation:**  
  The backgammon board is encoded as a feature vector, input to the neural network.

- **Learning Process:**  
  - At each move, the network predicts the value of the resulting board state.
  - After each game, the network parameters are updated using the TD(λ) algorithm.
  - The agent explores by occasionally making random moves (exploration vs. exploitation).

- **Neural Network Architecture:**  
  - Input layer: Encodes the board state.
  - Hidden layers: Capture complex patterns and strategies.
  - Output layer: Predicts the probability of winning from the current state.

- **TD(λ) Mechanism:**  
  - Blends short-term and long-term credit assignment via the $\lambda$ parameter.
  - $\lambda = 0$: Pure TD(0), updates based only on the next state.
  - $\lambda = 1$: Equivalent to Monte Carlo, updates based on the final outcome.
