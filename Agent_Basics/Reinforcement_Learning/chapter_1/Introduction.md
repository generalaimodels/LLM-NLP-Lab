## 1.1 Reinforcement Learning

### Definition
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a computational paradigm wherein an agent learns to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment, aiming to maximize cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled input/output pairs and instead relies on feedback in the form of scalar rewards.

### Pertinent Equations

- **Markov Decision Process (MDP):**
  $$
  \mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)
  $$
  - $\mathcal{S}$: Set of states
  - $\mathcal{A}$: Set of actions
  - $P(s'|s,a)$: Transition probability
  - $R(s,a)$: Reward function
  - $\gamma$: Discount factor, $0 \leq \gamma < 1$

- **Return:**
  $$
  G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k+1}
  $$

- **Policy:**
  $$
  \pi(a|s) = P(a_t = a | s_t = s)
  $$

- **Value Function:**
  $$
  V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi [G_t | s_t = s]
  $$

- **Action-Value Function:**
  $$
  Q^\pi(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_\pi [G_t | s_t = s, a_t = a]
  $$

- **Bellman Equation:**
  $$
  V^\pi(s) = \sum_{a} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a) + \gamma V^\pi(s')]
  $$

### Key Principles

- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Balancing the need to explore new actions to discover better rewards versus exploiting known actions that yield high rewards.
- **Delayed Reward:** Actions may have long-term consequences, requiring the agent to consider future rewards.
- **Policy Optimization:** Learning a policy $\pi$ that maximizes expected return.
- **Credit Assignment:** Determining which actions are responsible for observed outcomes.

### Detailed Concept Analysis

- **Agent-Environment Interaction:** At each timestep $t$, the agent observes state $s_t$, selects action $a_t$, receives reward $r_{t+1}$, and transitions to state $s_{t+1}$.
- **Learning Paradigms:**
  - **Model-Free RL:** Learns value functions or policies directly from experience (e.g., Q-learning, Policy Gradients).
  - **Model-Based RL:** Learns a model of the environment and uses it for planning.
- **Temporal Difference (TD) Learning:** Updates value estimates based on the difference between successive predictions.

### Importance

- **Autonomous Decision-Making:** RL enables agents to learn optimal behaviors in complex, uncertain environments.
- **Applications:** Robotics, game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), autonomous vehicles, resource management, recommendation systems.

### Pros vs. Cons

**Pros:**
- No need for labeled data.
- Handles sequential, long-term decision-making.
- Adaptable to dynamic environments.

**Cons:**
- Sample inefficiency; requires large amounts of interaction data.
- Instability and sensitivity to hyperparameters.
- Credit assignment and exploration remain challenging.

### Cutting-Edge Advances

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Integration of deep neural networks with RL (e.g., DQN, DDPG, PPO).
- **Meta-RL:** Agents that learn to learn, generalizing across tasks.
- **Multi-Agent RL:** Coordination and competition among multiple agents.
- **Offline RL:** Learning from fixed datasets without further environment interaction.
- **Hierarchical RL:** Decomposing tasks into sub-tasks for improved scalability.

## 1.3 Elements of Reinforcement Learning

### Definition

Core components that constitute the RL framework, enabling the agent to learn from interaction with the environment.

### Pertinent Equations

- **State Transition:**
  $$
  s_{t+1} \sim P(\cdot|s_t, a_t)
  $$
- **Reward Signal:**
  $$
  r_{t+1} = R(s_t, a_t)
  $$
- **Policy:**
  $$
  \pi(a|s)
  $$
- **Value Functions:**
  $$
  V(s),\ Q(s,a)
  $$

### Key Principles

- **Agent:** Learner/decision-maker.
- **Environment:** External system with which the agent interacts.
- **State ($s$):** Representation of the environment at a given time.
- **Action ($a$):** Choices available to the agent.
- **Reward ($r$):** Scalar feedback signal.
- **Policy ($\pi$):** Mapping from states to actions.
- **Value Function ($V$, $Q$):** Expected return from states or state-action pairs.
- **Model (optional):** Agentâ€™s internal representation of environment dynamics.

### Detailed Concept Analysis

- **Interaction Loop:** At each timestep, the agent:
  - Observes $s_t$
  - Selects $a_t$ via $\pi$
  - Receives $r_{t+1}$ and $s_{t+1}$
- **Learning Objective:** Maximize expected cumulative reward.
- **Policy Types:**
  - **Deterministic:** $a = \mu(s)$
  - **Stochastic:** $a \sim \pi(\cdot|s)$
- **Value Estimation:** Central to most RL algorithms for policy evaluation and improvement.

### Importance

- **Framework Generality:** RL elements are applicable across diverse domains.
- **Modularity:** Each element can be independently designed or learned.

### Pros vs. Cons

**Pros:**
- Modular, extensible framework.
- Supports both model-free and model-based approaches.

**Cons:**
- Complexity increases with high-dimensional state/action spaces.
- Partial observability and non-stationarity complicate learning.

### Cutting-Edge Advances

- **Representation Learning:** Using deep learning to encode states and actions.
- **World Models:** Learning compact, predictive models of environment dynamics.
- **Reward Shaping:** Designing reward functions to accelerate learning.

### Definition

Boundaries and inherent challenges of RL, including theoretical, practical, and computational constraints.

### Pertinent Equations

- **Sample Complexity:**

- **Partial Observability:** Incomplete state information.

### Detailed Concept Analysis

- **Sample Inefficiency:** RL often requires vast amounts of data, especially in high-dimensional or sparse-reward settings.
- **Stability and Convergence:** Many RL algorithms are sensitive to hyperparameters and may diverge.

- **Scalability:** Real-world applications may involve continuous, high-dimensional spaces and long horizons.

### Importance

- **Safe RL:** Ensuring safety and robustness during learning and deployment.
- **Transfer and Meta-Learning:** Enabling agents to generalize across tasks and domains.
