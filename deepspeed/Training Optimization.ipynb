    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Gradient accumulation is a technique that accumulates gradients over multiple mini-batches before performing a weight update, effectively enabling larger batch sizes without proportionally increasing memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "For a loss function $L$ and model parameters $\\theta$, gradient accumulation over $n$ steps is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla L_{accumulated} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\nabla L_i(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
