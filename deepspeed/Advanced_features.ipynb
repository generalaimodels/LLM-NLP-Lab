    "## 6. Progressive Layer Dropping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Progressive Layer Dropping (PLD) is a training efficiency technique in DeepSpeed that randomly skips (drops) certain layers during training iterations, reducing computational requirements while maintaining model quality through careful scheduling of the dropping rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "In a standard Transformer with $L$ layers, the forward pass is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_i = \\text{Layer}_i(h_{i-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With Progressive Layer Dropping, each layer is executed with probability $p_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_i = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "\\text{Layer}_i(h_{i-1}) & \\text{with probability } p_i \\\\\n",
    "h_{i-1} & \\text{with probability } 1 - p_i\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The dropping rate typically follows a schedule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_i(t) = \\min(1, p_{max} \\cdot f(t, i))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $t$ is the training step, $p_{max}$ is the maximum dropping rate, and $f$ controls how dropping rate increases over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effective training loss becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{PLD} = \\mathbb{E}_{S \\sim P}[\\mathcal{L}(f_S(x), y)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $S$ is a subset of kept layers sampled according to probability $P$, and $f_S$ is the network with only layers in $S$ active.\n",
