    "## 1. Activation Checkpointing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Activation checkpointing (also called gradient checkpointing) is a memory optimization technique that trades computation for memory by strategically discarding intermediate activations during the forward pass and recomputing them during the backward pass when needed for gradient calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "For a neural network with $L$ layers producing activations $a_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., L\\}$, traditional backpropagation requires storing all activations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Memory consumption} \\sim O(L)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With checkpointing applied every $c$ layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Memory consumption} \\sim O(L/c + c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Computation cost} \\sim O(L + c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Principles\n",
    "- Selectively stores activations only at strategically chosen checkpoint layers\n",
    "- Recomputes intermediate activations during backpropagation when needed\n",
    "- Creates optimal checkpointing schedule to minimize memory while limiting recomputation\n",
    "- Enables training of deeper models with fixed memory constraints\n",
    "- Mathematically equivalent to standard training (no approximations)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
