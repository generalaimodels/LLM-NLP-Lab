---

## 1. Definition

### Batch Normalization
- **Batch Normalization (BN)** is a technique to normalize the activations of each layer in a neural network across a mini-batch, stabilizing and accelerating training by reducing internal covariate shift.

### Dropout
- **Dropout** is a regularization method that randomly sets a subset of activations to zero during training, preventing co-adaptation of neurons and reducing overfitting.

## 2. Mathematical Equations

### Batch Normalization

- **Mini-batch Mean:**
  $$
  \mu_{\mathcal{B}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i
  $$
- **Mini-batch Variance:**
  $$
  \sigma^2_{\mathcal{B}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \mu_{\mathcal{B}})^2
  $$
- **Normalization:**
  $$
  \hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu_{\mathcal{B}}}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_{\mathcal{B}} + \epsilon}}
  $$
- **Scale and Shift:**
  $$
  y_i = \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
  $$
  - $x_i$: Input activation
  - $m$: Mini-batch size
  - $\epsilon$: Small constant for numerical stability
  - $\gamma, \beta$: Learnable parameters

### Dropout

- **Dropout Mask:**
  $$
  r_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)
  $$
- **Element-wise Multiplication:**
  $$
  \tilde{x}_i = r_i x_i
  $$
  - $p$: Probability of keeping a unit active
  - $r_i$: Random binary mask
  - $x_i$: Input activation

- **Test-time Scaling:**
  $$
  y_i = p x_i
  $$
  (Alternatively, scale activations during training by $1/p$.)

## 3. Pseudo-Algorithm

### Batch Normalization

1. **For each mini-batch $\mathcal{B}$:**
   - Compute mean: $\mu_{\mathcal{B}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i$
   - Compute variance: $\sigma^2_{\mathcal{B}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \mu_{\mathcal{B}})^2$
   - Normalize: $\hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu_{\mathcal{B}}}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_{\mathcal{B}} + \epsilon}}$
   - Scale and shift: $y_i = \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta$
2. **During inference:**
   - Use running averages of $\mu_{\mathcal{B}}$ and $\sigma^2_{\mathcal{B}}$.

### Dropout

1. **During training:**
   - For each unit $i$ in layer:
     - Sample $r_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$
     - Compute $\tilde{x}_i = r_i x_i$
2. **During inference:**
   - Use full network, scale activations by $p$ (or use $1/p$ scaling during training).

## 4. Underlying Principles and Mechanisms

### Batch Normalization

- **Reduces Internal Covariate Shift:** Normalizes layer inputs, stabilizing distributions across training.
- **Improves Gradient Flow:** Mitigates vanishing/exploding gradients by keeping activations within a controlled range.
- **Enables Higher Learning Rates:** Allows for more aggressive optimization.
- **Learnable Parameters:** $\gamma$ and $\beta$ restore representational power.

### Dropout

- **Prevents Co-adaptation:** Forces neurons to learn robust features by randomly omitting units.
- **Implicit Model Averaging:** Trains an ensemble of subnetworks, improving generalization.
- **Regularization:** Reduces overfitting, especially in large networks.

## 5. Significance and Use Cases

### Batch Normalization

- **Significance:** Essential for deep network training; accelerates convergence and improves stability.
- **Use Cases:** CNNs, RNNs (with modifications), Transformers, GANs.

### Dropout

- **Significance:** Standard regularization technique; simple and effective.
- **Use Cases:** Fully connected layers, CNNs, LSTMs (with care), large-scale deep learning models.

## 6. Advantages and Disadvantages

### Batch Normalization

**Advantages:**
- Faster convergence
- Higher learning rates possible
- Reduces sensitivity to initialization
- Acts as a regularizer

**Disadvantages:**
- Batch size dependence
- Less effective for small batches or online learning
- Complicates RNN training (use LayerNorm/GroupNorm as alternatives)

### Dropout

**Advantages:**
- Simple, effective regularization
- Reduces overfitting
- Easy to implement

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower convergence
- May require longer training
- Not always effective in convolutional layers or with batch normalization

## 7. Variants, Extensions, and Recent Developments

### Batch Normalization

- **Layer Normalization:** Normalizes across features, not batch; used in Transformers.
- **Instance Normalization:** Normalizes per sample; used in style transfer.
- **Group Normalization:** Normalizes over groups of channels; effective for small batches.
- **Batch Renormalization:** Addresses issues with small or non-i.i.d. batches.

### Dropout

- **Spatial Dropout:** Drops entire feature maps in CNNs.
- **DropConnect:** Drops weights instead of activations.
- **Variational Dropout:** Applies the same dropout mask at each time step in RNNs.
- **AlphaDropout:** Preserves mean and variance for self-normalizing networks (e.g., SELU).

## 8. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Batch Normalization

**Best Practices:**
- Use with sufficiently large batch sizes (typically $>16$).
- Place before nonlinearity (ReLU) in most architectures.
- Track running statistics for inference.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Small batch sizes degrade performance.
- Incorrect use in RNNs; prefer LayerNorm/GroupNorm.
- Forgetting to switch to running averages during inference.

### Dropout

**Best Practices:**
- Use higher dropout rates (e.g., $0.5$) for fully connected layers, lower for convolutional layers.
- Apply only during training.
- Combine with other regularization (e.g., weight decay).

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Using dropout during inference.
- Excessive dropout can underfit.
- Redundant with strong regularizers or batch normalization.
