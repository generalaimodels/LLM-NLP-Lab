### DINO (self-DIstillation with NO labels)

#### 1. Definition
DINO is a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that trains visual encoders, typically Vision Transformers (ViTs), without relying on human-annotated labels. It employs a self-distillation approach where a student network learns to match the output of a teacher network. The teacher network's parameters are an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student network's parameters (a momentum encoder). DINO uses multi-crop augmentation, centering, and sharpening of teacher outputs to prevent model collapse and learn robust representations.

#### 2. Pertinent Equations (Core DINO Framework)
Let $g_{\theta_s}$ denote the student network with parameters $\theta_s$, and $g_{\theta_t}$ denote the teacher network with parameters $\theta_t$. Both networks share the same architecture.
For an input image $x$, multiple augmented views (crops) $V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_K\}$ are generated. This set $V$ includes two global views ($v_1^g, v_2^g$) and several local views.

*   **Teacher Network Parameter Update (Exponential Moving Average - EMA):**
    The teacher parameters $\theta_t$ are updated based on the student parameters $\theta_s$:
    $$ \theta_t \leftarrow \lambda \theta_t + (1 - \lambda) \theta_s $$
    where $\lambda$ is a decay rate, typically scheduled from a value like $0.996$ to $1$ during training. This update is performed after each student parameter update.

*   **Output Probabilities (Softmax with Temperature):**
    Both student and teacher networks output $D$-dimensional logits. These are converted to probability distributions over $D$ classes using a softmax function with a temperature parameter.
    For the student network processing view $v$:
    $$ P_s(v)_d = \frac{\exp( (g_{\theta_s}(v))_d / \tau_s )}{\sum_{k=1}^D \exp( (g_{\theta_s}(v))_k / \tau_s )} $$
    For the teacher network processing a global view $v^g$:
    $$ P_t(v^g)_d = \frac{\exp( (g_{\theta_t}(v^g) - C)_d / \tau_t )}{\sum_{k=1}^D \exp( (g_{\theta_t}(v^g) - C)_k / \tau_t )} $$
    where $\tau_s$ and $\tau_t$ are the temperatures for the student and teacher, respectively ($\tau_t < \tau_s$, e.g., $\tau_s=0.1, \tau_t=0.04$). $C$ is a centering term.

*   **Centering Term Update:**
    The centering term $C$ (a $D$-dimensional vector) is updated as an EMA of the batch-wise mean of teacher outputs (logits before softmax):
    $$ C \leftarrow m C + (1-m) \frac{1}{B_{global}} \sum_{i=1}^{B_{global}} g_{\theta_t}(v_i^g) $$
    where $m$ is a rate parameter (e.g., $0.9$), $B_{global}$ is the total number of global views processed by the teacher in a batch. The centering is applied only to the teacher.

*   **DINO Loss Function:**
    The student network is trained to match the teacher network's output distribution. The loss is calculated as the cross-entropy between the teacher's output (for a global view) and the student's output (for any other view from the same original image). For a single image, with global views $V_g = \{v_1^g, v_2^g\}$ and the full set of views $V$:
    $$ L_{\text{DINO}} = - \sum_{v_g \in V_g} \sum_{v' \in V, v' \neq v_g} P_t(v_g) \cdot \log P_s(v') $$
    The teacher's outputs $P_t(v_g)$ are treated as fixed targets (i.e., gradients are not propagated through the teacher network, $\text{sg}(\cdot)$ operation):
    $$ L_{\text{DINO}} = - \sum_{v_g \in V_g} \sum_{v' \in V, v' \neq v_g} \text{sg}(P_t(v_g)) \cdot \log P_s(v') $$

#### 3. Key Principles
*   **Self-Distillation:** The student learns from a teacher which is an EMA of itself, distilling its own knowledge over time.
*   **Momentum Encoder:** The teacher network acts as a momentum encoder, providing stable and refined targets for the student. The EMA update ensures the teacher evolves slowly.
*   **No Negative Samples:** Unlike many contrastive learning methods, DINO does not explicitly require negative samples. It frames learning as predicting the teacher's output distribution for different views of the same image.
*   **Multi-Crop Augmentation:** Using multiple crops (2 global, several local) of an image allows the model to learn both global and local features and enforces view consistency. The student sees all crops, while the teacher only sees global crops. This encourages "local-to-global" correspondence.
*   **Avoiding Collapse:**
    *   **Centering:** Subtracting the mean of batch outputs $C$ from the teacher's features before softmax prevents a dominant dimension from emerging and ensures all dimensions are utilized.
    *   **Sharpening:** Using a lower temperature $\tau_t$ for the teacher's softmax makes its output distribution sharper (more confident), providing more distinct targets for the student.
*   **Stop-Gradient:** Gradients are not backpropagated through the teacher network. This prevents trivial solutions where student and teacher output identical constant values.

#### 4. Detailed Concept Analysis
DINO synergistically combines several established concepts into a powerful SSL framework. The student network $g_{\theta_s}$ is trained by minimizing the cross-entropy loss with respect to the teacher network $g_{\theta_t}$'s outputs. The teacher's weights $\theta_t$ are an EMA of the student's weights $\theta_s$, meaning $g_{\theta_t}$ provides a more stable and refined version of $g_{\theta_s}$ from previous training steps.

The multi-crop strategy is pivotal. An image is augmented into two global views (e.g., large crops covering >50% of the image area) and multiple local views (e.g., small crops covering <50% of the image area). The student network processes all views, while the teacher network processes only the global views. The loss encourages the student's representation of any view $v'$ to be predictive of the teacher's representation of a global view $v_g$ from the same image. This forces the student to learn representations that are consistent across different scales and parts of an image.

Mode collapse, a common issue in SSL, is addressed through centering and sharpening. Centering normalizes the teacher's outputs, preventing a single dimension from dominating the feature space. Sharpening the teacher's output distribution (by using a low temperature $\tau_t$) creates more distinct and confident targets, making the learning task for the student less ambiguous and more effective. The stop-gradient operation on the teacher network is crucial for preventing the student from trivially matching the teacher by, for example, making both networks output constant values.

DINO's success, particularly with ViTs, demonstrates that these architectures are well-suited for SSL and can learn rich semantic features, such as object segmentation properties, without explicit pixel-level supervision. The [CLS] token of the ViT, when trained with DINO, aggregates global image information effectively.

#### 5. Importance
*   **State-of-the-Art SSL:** DINO achieves SOTA performance in self-supervised representation learning, often outperforming supervised pre-training on various downstream tasks.

### Data Pre-processing

#### 1. Multi-crop Augmentation
This is a crucial component of DINO. For each input image $x$, a set of $V$ augmented views (crops) is generated. These views are categorized into:
*   **Global Views:** Typically 2 views, denoted $v^g_1, v^g_2$. These are generated by applying transformations that result in crops covering a large portion of the original image (e.g., random resized crop with scale range $[0.4, 1.0]$).
*   **Local Views:** Typically $V-2$ views, denoted $v^l_1, ..., v^l_{V-2}$. These are generated by applying transformations that result in crops covering a smaller portion of the original image (e.g., random resized crop with scale range $[0.05, 0.4]$).

Standard image augmentations applied to generate these views include:
*   **Random Resized Crop:** Samples a random rectangular region and resizes it to a fixed resolution (e.g., $224 \times 224$ for global views, $96 \times 96$ for local views).
*   **Horizontal Flip:** Applied with a probability of $0.5$.
*   **Color Jittering:** Randomly adjusts brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue.
*   **Gaussian Blur:** Applied with a certain probability.
*   **Solarization:** Inverts pixel values above a threshold, applied with a certain probability, typically only to global views for one view in teacher.

The exact parameters for these augmentations (e.g., scale ranges, jitter strengths) are critical hyperparameters. Global views receive weaker augmentation compared to local views to provide a more stable target from the teacher.

#### 2. Normalization
After augmentation, each view $v$ is normalized. If pixel values are in $[0, 255]$, they are typically scaled to $[0, 1]$ and then normalized using the mean and standard deviation of a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet):
$$ v_{norm} = \frac{v_{scaled} - \mu}{\sigma} $$
where $v_{scaled}$ is the image tensor with pixel values in $[0,1]$, $\mu$ is the mean vector (e.g., $[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]$), and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation vector (e.g., $[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]$) for each channel.

### Model Architecture

#### 1. Overview
DINO employs a dual-network architecture: a student network and a teacher network. Both networks share an identical architectural design but have different sets of weights.
*   **Student Network ($g_{\theta_s}$):** This network is trained via standard backpropagation. It processes all augmented views (global and local).
*   **Teacher Network ($g_{\theta_t}$):** This network's weights are an EMA of the student's weights. It only processes global views and its outputs serve as targets for the student. Gradients are not propagated through the teacher.

Both $g_{\theta_s}$ and $g_{\theta_t}$ consist of a backbone (e.g., ViT, ResNet) followed by a projection head (DINO head).

#### 2. Backbone Network (e.g., Vision Transformer - ViT)
Let the input be an image patch $v \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C'}$.
*   **Patch Embedding:**
    The image $v$ is divided into $N_p$ non-overlapping patches $x_p \in \mathbb{R}^{P \times P \times C'}$, where $P$ is the patch size. Each patch is flattened and linearly projected into a $D_{model}$-dimensional embedding. A learnable class token ([CLS]) $x_{class}$ is prepended to the sequence of patch embeddings. Positional embeddings $E_{pos}$ are added:
    $$ z_0 = [x_{class}; E x_p^1; E x_p^2; \dots; E x_p^{N_p}] + E_{pos} $$
    where $E \in \mathbb{R}^{(P^2 C') \times D_{model}}$ is the patch projection matrix. $z_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{(N_p+1) \times D_{model}}$.

*   **Transformer Encoder Block:**
    The ViT consists of $L$ identical Transformer encoder blocks. Each block $l$ has two main sub-layers: Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) and a position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN/MLP). Layer Normalization (LN) is applied before each sub-layer, and residual connections are used.
    For an input sequence $z_{l-1}$ to block $l$:
    1.  **Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA):**
        $$ z'_l = \text{MSA}(\text{LN}(z_{l-1})) + z_{l-1} $$
        Where MSA is defined as:
        $$ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_h}}\right)V $$
        $Q = z_{LN} W_q$, $K = z_{LN} W_k$, $V = z_{LN} W_v$ are query, key, and value matrices derived from $z_{LN} = \text{LN}(z_{l-1})$. $W_q, W_k, W_v \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{model} \times d_h}$ are weight matrices for a single head, and $d_h$ is the head dimension. For multi-head attention with $N_h$ heads, outputs are concatenated:
        $$ \text{MSA}(z_{LN}) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \dots, \text{head}_{N_h}) W^O $$
        where $\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(z_{LN}W_q^i, z_{LN}W_k^i, z_{LN}W_v^i)$, and $W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{N_h d_h \times D_{model}}$.

    2.  **Feed-Forward Network (FFN/MLP):**
        $$ z_l = \text{FFN}(\text{LN}(z'_l)) + z'_l $$
        The FFN is typically a two-layer MLP with a GELU activation:
        $$ \text{FFN}(x) = \text{GELU}(x W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2 $$
        where $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{model} \times D_{ff}}$, $b_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{ff}}$, $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{ff} \times D_{model}}$, $b_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{model}}$. $D_{ff}$ is the inner hidden dimension (e.g., $4 D_{model}$).

*   **[CLS] Token Output:**
    The output of the backbone for DINO is typically the representation of the [CLS] token from the final layer $L$: $f = (z_L)_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{model}}$. This feature vector $f$ is then passed to the projection head.

#### 3. Projection Head (DINO Head)
The DINO head is an MLP that projects the backbone output $f$ into the space where the softmax probabilities are computed.
Structure: A 3-layer MLP is common:
$f \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{model}} \xrightarrow{\text{Linear}} \mathbb{R}^{H_1} \xrightarrow{\text{GELU}} \mathbb{R}^{H_2} \xrightarrow{\text{Linear}} \mathbb{R}^{D_{out}}$
Typically $H_1 = H_2 = 2048$. The output dimension $D_{out}$ is the number of "prototypes" or classes for the softmax (e.g., $D_{out} = 65536$ for ViT-B/16).
Let $h_0 = f$.
$$ h_1 = \text{GELU}(W_1 h_0 + b_1) $$
$$ h_2 = \text{GELU}(W_2 h_1 + b_2) $$
$$ z = W_3 h_2 + b_3 $$
where $z \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{out}}$ are the logits. $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{H_1 \times D_{model}}$, $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{H_2 \times H_1}$, $W_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{out} \times H_2}$.
The final layer $W_3$ is often weight-normalized:
$$ W_3 = g \frac{V_3}{\|V_3\|_2} $$
where $g$ is a learnable scalar and $V_3$ are the weights before normalization. This can improve training stability. Some implementations may include $L_2$ normalization of the output $z$ before the final linear layer, creating a bottleneck.

#### 4. Teacher Network
*   **Parameter Update (EMA):** As stated before: $\theta_t \leftarrow \lambda \theta_t + (1 - \lambda) \theta_s$. $\lambda$ is scheduled, often starting at $0.996$ and increasing towards $1.0$ using a cosine schedule:
    $$ \lambda_e = \lambda_{final} - (\lambda_{final} - \lambda_{base}) \left( \frac{\cos(\pi e / E_{total})}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \right) $$
    where $e$ is current epoch, $E_{total}$ is total epochs. $\lambda_{base}$ (e.g., 0.996), $\lambda_{final}$ (e.g., 1.0).

*   **Stop-Gradient Mechanism:** During loss calculation, the teacher's outputs $P_t(v^g)$ (or its logits $g_{\theta_t}(v^g)$) are detached from the computation graph. This ensures that gradients only flow through the student network. Mathematically, this is $\text{sg}(P_t(v^g))$ or $\text{detach}(P_t(v^g))$.

### Training Procedure

#### 1. Loss Function (Reiteration with Batch Context)
The total loss over a mini-batch $B$ of images $\{x^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N_B}$ is the average of individual image losses:
$$ L_{total} = \frac{1}{N_B} \sum_{i=1}^{N_B} L_{\text{DINO}}^{(i)} $$
where $L_{\text{DINO}}^{(i)}$ is the DINO loss for image $x^{(i)}$:
$$ L_{\text{DINO}}^{(i)} = - \sum_{v_g \in V_g^{(i)}} \sum_{v' \in V^{(i)}, v' \neq v_g} \text{sg}(P_t(v_g)) \cdot \log P_s(v') $$
$V^{(i)}$ and $V_g^{(i)}$ are the sets of all views and global views for image $x^{(i)}$, respectively.

#### 2. Optimization
The student network parameters $\theta_s$ are updated using an optimizer like AdamW or SGD with momentum.
$$ \theta_s \leftarrow \theta_s - \eta \nabla_{\theta_s} L_{total} $$
where $\eta$ is the learning rate. A learning rate schedule (e.g., cosine decay with warm-up) is typically employed. Weight decay is also used.

#### 3. Pseudo-algorithm
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Initialize student network parameters $\theta_s$ randomly.
    *   Initialize teacher network parameters $\theta_t \leftarrow \theta_s$.
    *   Initialize EMA centering term $C \leftarrow \mathbf{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{out}}$.
    *   Set student temperature $\tau_s$, teacher temperature $\tau_t$.
    *   Set EMA decay rate for teacher $\lambda$ (and its schedule).
    *   Set EMA decay rate for center $m$.
    *   Set optimizer (e.g., AdamW) with learning rate $\eta$ and weight decay.

2.  **Training Loop (for each epoch $e=1, \dots, E_{total}$):**
    *   Update $\lambda$ according to its schedule based on current epoch $e$.
    *   **For each mini-batch $B = \{x^{(1)}, \dots, x^{(N_B)}\}$:**
        a.  **Data Augmentation:** For each image $x^{(i)} \in B$:
            *   Generate $N_{gcrops}$ global views $V_g^{(i)} = \{v_{i,1}^g, \dots, v_{i,N_{gcrops}}^g\}$.
            *   Generate $N_{lcrops}$ local views $V_l^{(i)} = \{v_{i,1}^l, \dots, v_{i,N_{lcrops}}^l\}$.
            *   Let $V^{(i)} = V_g^{(i)} \cup V_l^{(i)}$ be the set of all $N_{crops}$ views for image $x^{(i)}$.
        b.  **Forward Pass (Student):** For each view $v \in V^{(i)}$ for all $i$:
            *   Compute student logits: $z_{s,v} = g_{\theta_s}(v)$.
            *   Compute student probabilities: $P_s(v) = \text{softmax}(z_{s,v} / \tau_s)$.
        c.  **Forward Pass (Teacher):** For each global view $v_g \in V_g^{(i)}$ for all $i$:
            *   Compute teacher logits (no gradients): $z_{t,v_g} = \text{sg}(g_{\theta_t}(v_g))$.
        d.  **Update Center $C$:**
            *   Collect all teacher logits $\{z_{t,v_g}\}$ from the current batch.
            *   Compute batch mean of teacher logits: $\bar{z}_{t,batch} = \frac{1}{N_B \cdot N_{gcrops}} \sum_{i,j} z_{t,v_{i,j}^g}$.
            *   Update $C$: $C \leftarrow m C + (1-m) \bar{z}_{t,batch}$.
        e.  **Compute Teacher Probabilities:** For each global view $v_g \in V_g^{(i)}$ for all $i$:
            *   Compute centered and sharpened teacher probabilities: $P_t(v_g) = \text{softmax}((z_{t,v_g} - C) / \tau_t)$.
        f.  **Compute Loss $L_{total}$:**
            *   Calculate $L_{\text{DINO}}^{(i)}$ for each image $x^{(i)}$ using $P_s(\cdot)$ and $P_t(\cdot)$.
            *   $L_{total} = \frac{1}{N_B} \sum_{i=1}^{N_B} L_{\text{DINO}}^{(i)}$.
        g.  **Backward Pass & Optimization:**
            *   Compute gradients: $\nabla_{\theta_s} L_{total}$.
            *   Update student parameters: $\theta_s \leftarrow \text{OptimizerStep}(\theta_s, \nabla_{\theta_s} L_{total})$.
        h.  **Update Teacher Parameters (EMA):**
            *   $\theta_t \leftarrow \lambda \theta_t + (1 - \lambda) \theta_s$.

### Post-training Procedures

Once the DINO model is pre-trained, its learned representations (typically from the backbone, before the DINO projection head) are used for various downstream tasks.

#### 1. Feature Extraction
The pre-trained backbone $f_{\theta_s}$ (student network, without projection head) is used as a feature extractor. For an input image $x$, the output is $f_{\theta_s}(x)$, which is the [CLS] token embedding if ViT is used, or the pooled global feature map if a CNN is used.

#### 2. Downstream Task Adaptation
*   **k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) Evaluation:**
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Extract features for all images in the training set of a labeled dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K training set). Store these features and their corresponding labels.
        2.  For each image in the validation set, extract its feature.
        3.  Find the $k$ nearest training set features using a distance metric (e.g., cosine similarity or Euclidean distance).
            $$ d(f_1, f_2) = 1 - \frac{f_1 \cdot f_2}{\|f_1\| \|f_2\|} \quad (\text{cosine distance})$$
        4.  Predict the label of the validation image by majority vote among the labels of its $k$ nearest neighbors.
    *   **Significance:** Measures the quality and separability of the learned feature space directly without training additional layers.

*   **Linear Probing:**
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Freeze the weights of the pre-trained backbone $f_{\theta_s}$.
        2.  Add a new linear classification layer $W_{cls}$ on top of the extracted features: $y_{logits} = W_{cls} f_{\theta_s}(x)$.
        3.  Train only the weights $W_{cls}$ on a labeled training set (e.g., ImageNet-1K) using a standard classification loss (e.g., cross-entropy).
            $$ L_{CE} = - \sum_{j=1}^{N_{classes}} y_j \log(\text{softmax}(y_{logits})_j) $$
            where $y_j$ is the one-hot encoded true label.
    *   **Significance:** Evaluates the linear separability of the learned features for a specific classification task.

*   **Fine-tuning:**
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Initialize the backbone with pre-trained DINO weights.
        2.  Add a task-specific head (e.g., classifier for image classification, detection head for object detection).
        3.  Train the entire network (or parts of it, e.g., last few layers of backbone + head) on the downstream task's labeled dataset, typically with a smaller learning rate than training from scratch.
    *   **Significance:** Adapts the learned representations more deeply to the specifics of the downstream task, often yielding the best performance.

### Evaluation Phase

#### 1. Metrics (State-of-the-Art - SOTA)
The primary evaluation for SSL methods like DINO involves assessing the quality of learned representations on standard benchmarks.
*   **ImageNet k-NN Accuracy:**
    *   **Definition:** Accuracy achieved using the k-NN classification procedure described above on the ImageNet-1K validation set.
    *   **Equation (Accuracy):**
        $$ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correctly Classified Images}}{\text{Total Number of Images in Validation Set}} $$
    *   SOTA DINO models (e.g., ViT-B/8) achieve >78% top-1 k-NN accuracy on ImageNet.

*   **ImageNet Linear Probing Accuracy:**
    *   **Definition:** Accuracy achieved by training a linear classifier on frozen features extracted from the ImageNet-1K training set, evaluated on the validation set.
    *   **Equation (Accuracy):** Same as above.
    *   SOTA DINO models (e.g., ViT-B/8) achieve >80% top-1 linear probing accuracy on ImageNet.

#### 2. Downstream Task Metrics
Performance on various downstream tasks further validates the generalizability of DINO features.
*   **Object Detection (e.g., COCO dataset):**
    *   **Metric:** Mean Average Precision (mAP).
    *   **Definition (AP):** For a given class, AP is the area under the precision-recall curve.
        $$ \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}, \quad \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP+FN} $$
        where $TP$ = True Positives, $FP$ = False Positives, $FN$ = False Negatives.
    *   **Definition (mAP):** The mean of AP values across all object classes and/or IoU thresholds.

*   **Semantic Segmentation (e.g., PASCAL VOC2012, ADE20K):**
    *   **Metric:** Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).
    *   **Definition (IoU):** For a given class, IoU is the ratio of the area of intersection to the area of union between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask.
        $$ \text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Area of Overlap}}{\text{Area of Union}} = \frac{TP}{TP+FP+FN} $$
    *   **Definition (mIoU):** The mean of IoU values across all semantic classes.

#### 3. Loss Functions (as an indicator during training)
*   **DINO Loss ($L_{\text{DINO}}$):** While primarily a training objective, monitoring its value during training is crucial. A steadily decreasing loss indicates stable learning.
    $$ L_{\text{DINO}} = - \sum_{v_g \in V_g} \sum_{v' \in V, v' \neq v_g} \text{sg}(P_t(v_g)) \cdot \log P_s(v') $$
    Its magnitude can also be compared across different hyperparameter settings to guide tuning. Low, stable loss generally correlates with good downstream performance.
