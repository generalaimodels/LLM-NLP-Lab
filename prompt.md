Okay, this is an excellent challenge! You want a template that *forces* the AI to prioritize realism, beauty, professionalism, and a specific aesthetic, while strictly excluding text.

Here's an advanced prompt template designed to achieve those goals. It uses strong keywords, suggestive phrasing, and a clear structure.

```

--no text, words, letters, numbers, typography, watermark, signature, logo, labels, captions, writing, font, characters, symbols
--no ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn feet, poorly drawn face, out of frame, extra limbs, disfigured, deformed, body out of frame, blurry, bad anatomy, blurred, watermark, grainy, signature, cut off, draft, low quality, worst quality, jpeg artifacts, compression artifacts, noise, error, mutation, mutilated, malformed, duplicate, morbid, gross, disgusting, too many fingers, fused fingers, malformed limbs, missing limbs, extra fingers, bad proportions

**How to Use This Template:**

1.  **Replace `{{user_prompt}}`:** Insert the user's core idea for the image.
2.  **Make Choices in Bracketed Sections:**
    *   For camera/lens: Pick one or a combination that suits the desired style (e.g., portrait lens for a portrait, wide for landscape).
    *   For mood/lighting/color palette/background: Be as descriptive as possible. The more specific you are, the better the AI can interpret your vision for "very nice background color" and overall look.
3.  **Combine Sections:** The commas at the end of most lines are intentional. You'll generally concatenate these sections into one long prompt string for the AI.
4.  **Negative Prompts (`--no` or your AI's specific syntax):** This section is *critical*. It explicitly tells the AI what to avoid. The "zero unnecessary text" is heavily emphasized here. Most modern AIs use `--no` or a similar flag for negative prompts. Check your specific AI's documentation.

**Why this template is "Advanced" and addresses your needs:**

1.  **Specificity:** It forces detailed thinking about aspects often left vague (camera, lens, precise lighting, specific color palettes).
2.  **Keyword Stacking:** It uses multiple strong, positive keywords related to realism, beauty, and professionalism.
3.  **Emphasis on "Novel" and "Beautiful":** Keywords like "novel concept," "breathtakingly beautiful," "perfect aesthetic" guide the AI.
4.  **"4K Resolution" and Quality:** Explicitly requested and reinforced.
5.  **"Very Nice Background Color":** The template provides a dedicated section for describing the background and color palette with an explicit reminder.
6.  **"Zero Unnecessary Text":** The negative prompt section is extensive and specifically targets text in all its forms, along with other common image artifacts.
7.  **Professionalism:** Terms like "professional photography," "award-winning," "studio lighting" (if chosen), "professional grade" steer the AI.
8.  **Structure:** The clear sections make it easier to construct and modify complex prompts.

This template provides a strong foundation. You might still need to iterate and adjust based on the specific AI model you're using, as different models have different sensitivities to keywords and prompt structure.
