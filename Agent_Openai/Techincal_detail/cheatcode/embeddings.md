# Embeddings in AI: A Comprehensive Analysis

## 1. Definition

Embeddings are dense vector representations of discrete objects (words, sentences, images, users, etc.) in continuous vector spaces where semantic relationships between objects are preserved as geometric relationships between vectors. These representations capture meaningful semantic, syntactic, or contextual information by mapping high-dimensional, sparse data into lower-dimensional dense vectors.

Formally, an embedding function $f$ maps an object $x$ from a discrete space $X$ to a vector $\vec{v}$ in a continuous space $\mathbb{R}^d$:

$$f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$$

## 2. Mathematical Formulation

### 2.1 Vector Space Model

Objects are represented as points in a vector space, where proximity corresponds to similarity. For two objects $a$ and $b$ with embeddings $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, their similarity can be measured using:

- Cosine similarity: $$\text{sim}(a, b) = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{d} a_i b_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{d} a_i^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{d} b_i^2}}$$

- Euclidean distance: $$d(a, b) = |\vec{a} - \vec{b}| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{d}(a_i - b_i)^2}$$

### 2.2 Learning Objective

Embedding models typically minimize a loss function $L$ that encourages similar objects to have similar embeddings:

$$L = \sum_{(x,y) \in S} l(f(x), f(y)) + \sum_{(x,z) \in D} l'(f(x), f(z))$$

Where $S$ is a set of similar pairs, $D$ is a set of dissimilar pairs, and $l$ and $l'$ are loss functions promoting similarity and dissimilarity, respectively.

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Distributional Hypothesis

The semantic meaning of words (and other objects) can be inferred from their distribution in text: "words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings." This principle underlies most embedding techniques.

### 3.2 Dimensionality Reduction

Embeddings compress high-dimensional sparse representations (e.g., one-hot encodings) into low-dimensional dense vectors, retaining essential information while reducing computational complexity.

### 3.3 Geometric Encoding of Relations

Embeddings encode semantic relationships geometrically. For example, in word embeddings, analogical relationships often appear as vector arithmetic:

$$\vec{v}_{king} - \vec{v}_{man} + \vec{v}_{woman} \approx \vec{v}_{queen}$$

## 4. Embedding Methods

### 4.1 Traditional Methods

#### 4.1.1 One-Hot Encoding
Each object is represented as a sparse binary vector where only one dimension is 1 and all others are 0.

$$\text{one-hot}(w_i) = [0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]$$

#### 4.1.2 TF-IDF Representations
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency represents words based on their importance:

$$\text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t, D)$$

$$\text{IDF}(t, D) = \log\frac{N}{|\{d \in D: t \in d\}|}$$

### 4.2 Neural Word Embeddings

#### 4.2.1 Word2Vec
Two architectures:
- Skip-gram: Predicts context words given a target word
- CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words): Predicts target word from context

The Skip-gram objective maximizes:

$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\sum_{-c \leq j \leq c, j \neq 0}\log p(w_{t+j}|w_t)$$

Where $p(w_o|w_i) = \frac{\exp(v_{w_o}^{\prime T} v_{w_i})}{\sum_{w=1}^{W} \exp(v_{w}^{\prime T} v_{w_i})}$

#### 4.2.2 GloVe (Global Vectors)
Combines global matrix factorization and local context window methods:

$$J = \sum_{i,j=1}^{V} f(X_{ij})(\vec{w}_i^T\vec{w}_j + b_i + b_j - \log X_{ij})^2$$

Where $X_{ij}$ is the co-occurrence count, and $f(X_{ij})$ is a weighting function.

#### 4.2.3 FastText
Extends Word2Vec by representing words as bags of character n-grams:

$$\vec{v}_w = \frac{1}{|G_w|} \sum_{g \in G_w} \vec{z}_g$$

Where $G_w$ is the set of n-grams in word $w$, and $\vec{z}_g$ is the vector for n-gram $g$.

### 4.3 Contextual Embeddings

#### 4.3.1 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
Produces context-dependent embeddings using bidirectional attention:

$$\text{BERT}(x_1,...,x_n) = [\vec{h}_1,...,\vec{h}_n]$$

Where $\vec{h}_i$ represents the contextual embedding of token $x_i$.

Training objectives include:
- Masked Language Modeling (MLM): $$L_{MLM} = -\mathbb{E}_{(x,m) \sim D} \sum_{i: m_i=1} \log p(x_i|\tilde{x})$$
- Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): $$L_{NSP} = -\mathbb{E}_{(x,y,l) \sim D} \log p(l|x,y)$$

#### 4.3.2 Sentence-BERT
Fine-tunes BERT for sentence embeddings using siamese and triplet network structures:

$$L = \sum_{(a,b,c)} \max(0, \|\vec{a}-\vec{b}\|-\|\vec{a}-\vec{c}\|+\epsilon)$$

### 4.4 Specialized Embedding Models

#### 4.4.1 Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
For embedding nodes in graphs:

$$\vec{h}_v^{(k)} = \text{UPDATE}^{(k)}(\vec{h}_v^{(k-1)}, \text{AGGREGATE}^{(k)}(\{\vec{h}_u^{(k-1)}: u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}))$$

#### 4.4.2 Cross-Modal Embeddings
Maps different modalities (text, images, audio) into shared spaces:

$$L = \sum_{(x_i,y_i)} \|f_X(x_i) - g_Y(y_i)\|^2$$

## 5. Training Objectives

### 5.1 Contrastive Learning
Minimizes distance between positive pairs and maximizes distance between negative pairs:

$$L_{\text{contrastive}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i d(a_i, b_i)^2 + (1-y_i) \max(0, \epsilon - d(a_i, b_i))^2$$

### 5.2 Triplet Loss
Uses anchor, positive, and negative examples:

$$L_{\text{triplet}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \max(0, d(a_i, p_i) - d(a_i, n_i) + \alpha)$$

### 5.3 InfoNCE Loss
Used in self-supervised learning:

$$L_{\text{InfoNCE}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(q, k_+)/\tau)}{\sum_{i=0}^{K} \exp(\text{sim}(q, k_i)/\tau)}$$
