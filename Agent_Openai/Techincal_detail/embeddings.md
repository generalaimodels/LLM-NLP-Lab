# Embeddings in Artificial Intelligence

## Definition

Embeddings refer to the representation of high-dimensional, sparse, or categorical data (such as text, images, or graphs) as dense, continuous, low-dimensional vectors in a latent space. These vectors, also known as embeddings, capture the semantic, syntactic, or structural properties of the data in a way that facilitates efficient computation and learning in machine learning models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and graph-based tasks.

Mathematically, an embedding is a mapping function $f$ that transforms an input $x$ from a high-dimensional space $X$ (e.g., one-hot encoded vectors, pixel values, or graph adjacency matrices) into a lower-dimensional space $Z$:

$$ f: X \rightarrow Z $$

where $Z \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and $d$ is the dimensionality of the embedding space, typically much smaller than the dimensionality of $X$.

## Core Principles of Embeddings

Embeddings are rooted in the idea of preserving meaningful relationships (e.g., semantic similarity, structural properties) in the lower-dimensional space. The core principles include:

1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: High-dimensional data is compressed into a lower-dimensional space while retaining essential information.
2. **Semantic Preservation**: Similar entities (e.g., words, images, or nodes in a graph) are mapped to nearby points in the embedding space, and dissimilar entities are mapped far apart.
3. **Learnability**: Embeddings are typically learned from data using optimization techniques, ensuring they capture patterns inherent in the data.
4. **Generalization**: Embeddings enable models to generalize to unseen data by leveraging the continuous nature of the latent space.

## Objectives of Embeddings

The primary objective of embeddings is to create representations that are both computationally efficient and semantically meaningful. Specific objectives include:

- **Efficient Computation**: Dense embeddings reduce memory and computational requirements compared to sparse representations, enabling scalable machine learning models.
- **Improved Model Performance**: By capturing semantic relationships, embeddings enhance the performance of tasks such as classification, clustering, recommendation, and generation.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained embeddings (e.g., word embeddings, image embeddings) can be reused across tasks, reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering.
- **Interpretability**: Embeddings provide a way to visualize and interpret complex data by projecting it into a lower-dimensional space.

## Methods for Generating Embeddings

Embeddings can be generated using various methods, depending on the type of data and the task. Below, we discuss the most prominent methods for text embeddings, along with their mathematical foundations.

### 1. Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are a foundational technique in NLP for representing words as dense vectors. The key methods include:

#### a) Word2Vec
Word2Vec is a predictive model that learns word embeddings by predicting a word given its context (Continuous Bag of Words, CBOW) or predicting the context given a word (Skip-gram).

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  Word2Vec minimizes the following objective function, which measures the log-likelihood of predicting context words given a target word (Skip-gram):

  $$ J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{-c \leq j \leq c, j \neq 0} \log P(w_{t+j} | w_t) $$

  where $T$ is the number of words in the corpus, $c$ is the context window size, and $P(w_{t+j} | w_t)$ is the probability of observing context word $w_{t+j}$ given target word $w_t$. This probability is computed using a softmax function over the dot product of word embeddings:

  $$ P(w_{t+j} | w_t) = \frac{\exp(u_{w_{t+j}}^\top v_{w_t})}{\sum_{w \in V} \exp(u_w^\top v_{w_t})} $$

  Here, $v_{w_t}$ is the embedding of the target word, and $u_{w_{t+j}}$ is the embedding of the context word.

- **Core Concept**:
  The model learns two sets of embeddings: target word embeddings ($v_w$) and context word embeddings ($u_w$). After training, the target embeddings are typically used as the final word representations.

#### b) GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)
GloVe is a count-based model that leverages global co-occurrence statistics to learn word embeddings.

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  GloVe minimizes the following loss function, which models the relationship between word embeddings and their co-occurrence counts:

  $$ J = \sum_{i,j=1}^V f(X_{ij}) (u_i^\top v_j + b_i + b_j - \log X_{ij})^2 $$

  where $X_{ij}$ is the co-occurrence count of words $i$ and $j$, $u_i$ and $v_j$ are the embeddings of words $i$ and $j$, $b_i$ and $b_j$ are bias terms, and $f(X_{ij})$ is a weighting function to handle rare co-occurrences.

- **Core Concept**:
  GloVe combines the advantages of global matrix factorization (e.g., LSA) and local context-based learning (e.g., Word2Vec), resulting in embeddings that capture both local and global semantic relationships.

#### c) FastText
FastText extends Word2Vec by representing words as bags of character n-grams, enabling better handling of rare and out-of-vocabulary words.

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  FastText modifies the Skip-gram objective by representing a word $w$ as the sum of its character n-gram embeddings:

  $$ v_w = \sum_{g \in G_w} z_g $$

  where $G_w$ is the set of n-grams in word $w$, and $z_g$ is the embedding of n-gram $g$. The Skip-gram objective is then applied as in Word2Vec.

- **Core Concept**:
  By modeling subword information, FastText captures morphological information, making it particularly effective for languages with rich morphology.

### 2. Contextual Embeddings

Unlike static embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe), contextual embeddings generate different representations for the same word depending on its context. Key methods include:

#### a) ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)
ELMo uses bidirectional LSTMs to generate contextual embeddings by modeling the entire sentence.

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  ELMo computes the embedding of a word $w_t$ as a weighted combination of hidden states from all layers of a bidirectional LSTM:

  $$ \text{ELMo}_t = \gamma \sum_{j=0}^L s_j h_{t,j} $$

  where $h_{t,j}$ is the hidden state of the $j$-th layer, $s_j$ are learned weights, $\gamma$ is a scaling factor, and $L$ is the number of layers.

- **Core Concept**:
  ELMo captures deep contextual information by leveraging bidirectional language modeling, making it suitable for tasks requiring nuanced understanding of context.

#### b) BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
BERT is a transformer-based model that generates contextual embeddings by pre-training on masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction tasks.

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  BERT uses the transformer architecture, which relies on self-attention mechanisms. The self-attention operation for a token $x_i$ is computed as:

  $$ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V $$

  where $Q$, $K$, and $V$ are query, key, and value matrices derived from the input embeddings, and $d_k$ is the dimensionality of the keys. BERT’s MLM objective involves predicting masked tokens in a sentence, optimizing the following loss:

  $$ L = -\sum_{m \in M} \log P(x_m | x_{\setminus M}) $$

  where $M$ is the set of masked tokens, and $x_{\setminus M}$ is the unmasked portion of the sentence.

- **Core Concept**:
  BERT’s bidirectional nature allows it to capture rich contextual information, making it highly effective for a wide range of downstream NLP tasks.

### 3. Sentence and Document Embeddings

For tasks requiring representations of entire sentences or documents, methods like the following are used:

#### a) Doc2Vec
Doc2Vec extends Word2Vec to learn embeddings for variable-length text, such as sentences or documents.

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  Doc2Vec introduces a paragraph vector $d_p$ for each document, which is concatenated with word embeddings in the CBOW or Skip-gram framework. The objective is similar to Word2Vec, but includes the paragraph vector in the prediction task.

- **Core Concept**:
  Doc2Vec captures document-level semantics, making it suitable for tasks like document classification and clustering.

#### b) Sentence-BERT (SBERT)
SBERT fine-tunes BERT to produce fixed-length sentence embeddings optimized for tasks like semantic similarity.

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  SBERT uses a siamese network architecture, where two identical BERT models process pairs of sentences. The embeddings are pooled (e.g., mean pooling) to produce fixed-length vectors, and the model is fine-tuned on a contrastive loss, such as:

  $$ L = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(u, v))}{\sum_{v' \in V} \exp(\text{sim}(u, v'))} $$

  where $\text{sim}(u, v)$ is a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity) between sentence embeddings $u$ and $v$.

- **Core Concept**:
  SBERT produces efficient sentence embeddings, enabling fast similarity comparisons and clustering.

### 4. Graph Embeddings

For graph-structured data, embeddings capture structural and relational information. Key methods include:

#### a) Node2Vec
Node2Vec learns node embeddings in a graph by performing biased random walks and optimizing a Skip-gram-like objective.

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  Node2Vec maximizes the likelihood of observing a node’s neighborhood, given its embedding:

  $$ \log P(N_s(v) | v) = \sum_{u \in N_s(v)} \log P(u | v) $$

  where $N_s(v)$ is the neighborhood of node $v$ sampled via biased random walks, and $P(u | v)$ is computed using a softmax function over node embeddings.

- **Core Concept**:
  Node2Vec balances local and global structural information, making it suitable for tasks like node classification and link prediction.

#### b) Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
GNNs learn node embeddings by aggregating information from neighboring nodes using message-passing frameworks.

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  A GNN updates the embedding of a node $v$ at layer $k$ as:

  $$ h_v^{(k)} = \sigma \left( W^{(k)} \sum_{u \in N(v)} \frac{h_u^{(k-1)}}{|N(v)|} + B^{(k)} h_v^{(k-1)} \right) $$

  where $N(v)$ is the set of neighbors of $v$, $h_v^{(k)}$ is the embedding of $v$ at layer $k$, $\sigma$ is an activation function, and $W^{(k)}$ and $B^{(k)}$ are learnable parameters.

- **Core Concept**:
  GNNs capture complex graph structures, making them powerful for tasks like graph classification and recommendation.
