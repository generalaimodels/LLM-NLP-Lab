## Overview of the `Responses` Class

The `Responses` class is a Python class that inherits from `SyncAPIResource`, indicating it is part of a synchronous API client framework designed for making HTTP requests to a remote API. The class is primarily responsible for managing and generating responses from a model, such as a language or multimodal AI model. It provides methods and properties to:

1. Handle input data (via `input_items`).
2. Access raw or streaming responses (via `with_raw_response` and `with_streaming_response`).
3. Create model responses (via the `create` method) with extensive customization options.

The class is designed to be highly flexible, supporting a variety of input types, model configurations, and output formats, making it suitable for advanced use cases like conversational AI, function calling, and structured data generation.

## Technical Pipeline of the `Responses` Class

The `Responses` class operates as part of a larger API client ecosystem. Below is the high-level technical pipeline for how this class interacts with an API to generate model responses:

### Step 1: Initialization
- The `Responses` class is instantiated as part of an API client, typically passed a `_client` object (likely an HTTP client or API client instance) during initialization.
- The `_client` object is used internally to make HTTP requests to the API backend.

### Step 2: Accessing Input Data
- The `input_items` property provides access to an `InputItems` object, which is likely responsible for handling and formatting input data (e.g., text, images, or files) to be sent to the model.

### Step 3: Configuring Response Type
- Developers can choose how to receive the API response by using:
  - `with_raw_response`: Returns the raw HTTP response object, including headers and unparsed content.
  - `with_streaming_response`: Provides a streaming response, allowing data to be processed incrementally without eagerly loading the entire response body.

### Step 4: Creating a Model Response
- The `create` method is used to generate a model response by sending a request to the API. This method supports a wide range of parameters to customize the input, model behavior, and output format.
- The method is overloaded to handle both streaming (`stream=True`) and non-streaming (`stream=False`) responses, returning different types of response objects accordingly.

### Step 5: Processing the Response
- Depending on the configuration:
  - For non-streaming responses, the `create` method returns a parsed `Response` object.
  - For streaming responses, the response is processed incrementally, often using server-sent events (SSE).
  - If `with_raw_response` is used, the raw HTTP response is returned instead of a parsed object.

### Step 6: Storing or Using the Response
- The response can be stored (if `store=True` is set) for later retrieval or used immediately in the application.

## Detailed Explanation of Attributes and Methods

Below, we will break down each component of the `Responses` class in great detail, covering its attributes, properties, methods, parameters, and use cases.

### 1. Class Inheritance
```python
class Responses(SyncAPIResource):
```
- **Purpose**: The `Responses` class inherits from `SyncAPIResource`, indicating it is part of a synchronous API client framework. This base class likely provides methods for making HTTP requests, handling authentication, and managing API responses.
- **Behavior**: The synchronous nature implies that API calls block execution until a response is received, as opposed to asynchronous frameworks (e.g., `AsyncAPIResource`).

---

### 2. Properties

The `Responses` class defines three key properties, all decorated with `@cached_property` to ensure efficient access by caching the results of expensive computations.

#### 2.1. `input_items` Property
```python
@cached_property
def input_items(self) -> InputItems:
    return InputItems(self._client)
```
- **Purpose**: Provides access to an `InputItems` object, which is likely a helper class for managing and formatting input data to be sent to the model.
- **Technical Details**:
  - The `@cached_property` decorator ensures that the `InputItems` object is instantiated only once and reused on subsequent accesses, improving performance.
  - The `self._client` attribute is an HTTP client or API client instance passed to the `Responses` class during initialization. It is forwarded to the `InputItems` object to enable API interactions.
- **Use Case**: Developers use this property to prepare and validate input data (e.g., text, images, or files) before calling the `create` method.

#### 2.2. `with_raw_response` Property
```python
@cached_property
def with_raw_response(self) -> ResponsesWithRawResponse:
    """
    This property can be used as a prefix for any HTTP method call to return
    the raw response object instead of the parsed content.

    For more information, see https://www.github.com/openai/openai-python#accessing-raw-response-data-eg-headers
    """
    return ResponsesWithRawResponse(self)
```
- **Purpose**: Enables developers to access the raw HTTP response object (e.g., headers, status code, and unparsed body) instead of the parsed response content.
- **Technical Details**:
  - The `@cached_property` decorator ensures the `ResponsesWithRawResponse` object is created only once.
  - The `ResponsesWithRawResponse` class is likely a wrapper that modifies the behavior of HTTP method calls (e.g., `create`) to return raw responses.
  - This is useful for debugging, logging, or accessing metadata like HTTP headers.
- **Use Case**:
  ```python
  raw_response = responses.with_raw_response.create(input="Hello", model="gpt-4o")
  print(raw_response.status_code)  # Access HTTP status code
  print(raw_response.headers)      # Access HTTP headers
  ```

#### 2.3. `with_streaming_response` Property
```python
@cached_property
def with_streaming_response(self) -> ResponsesWithStreamingResponse:
    """
    An alternative to `.with_raw_response` that doesn't eagerly read the response body.

    For more information, see https://www.github.com/openai/openai-python#with_streaming_response
    """
    return ResponsesWithStreamingResponse(self)
```
- **Purpose**: Provides a streaming version of the response, allowing developers to process data incrementally without loading the entire response body into memory.
- **Technical Details**:
  - The `@cached_property` decorator ensures the `ResponsesWithStreamingResponse` object is created only once.
  - The `ResponsesWithStreamingResponse` class is likely a wrapper that modifies HTTP method calls to return streaming responses, often using server-sent events (SSE).
  - This is particularly useful for large responses or real-time applications.
- **Use Case**:
  ```python
  streaming_response = responses.with_streaming_response.create(input="Hello", model="gpt-4o", stream=True)
  for chunk in streaming_response:
      print(chunk)  # Process response chunks incrementally
  ```

---

### 3. Methods

The `Responses` class defines a single primary method, `create`, which is responsible for generating model responses. The method is overloaded to handle both streaming and non-streaming responses, as indicated by the `@overload` decorator.

#### 3.1. `create` Method (Non-Streaming)

  - **Use Case**: Allows developers to select a specific model based on capabilities, performance, or cost.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    model = "gpt-4o"
    ```

#### 4.2. Optional Parameters with `NotGiven` Defaults
Many parameters use `NotGiven` as a default, indicating they are optional and will not be included in the API request if not specified. This is a common pattern in API client libraries to distinguish between `None` (explicitly set to null) and "not provided."

- **`include: Optional[List[ResponseIncludable]] | NotGiven`**
  - **Purpose**: Specifies additional data to include in the model response.
  - **Type**: A list of `ResponseIncludable` values (likely an enum or string literals).

    include = ["file_search_call.results"]
    ```

- **`instructions: Optional[str] | NotGiven`**
  - **Purpose**: Provides a system or developer message to guide the modelâ€™s behavior, inserted as the first item in the modelâ€™s context.
  - **Type**: A string.
  - **Use Case**: Used to set the tone, role, or context of the model (e.g., "Act as a helpful assistant").
  - **Note**: When used with `previous_response_id`, previous instructions are not carried over, allowing easy swapping of system messages.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    instructions = "Act as a professional technical writer."
    ```

- **`max_output_tokens: Optional[int] | NotGiven`**
  - **Purpose**: Sets an upper limit on the number of tokens the model can generate, including both visible output and reasoning tokens.
  - **Type**: An integer.
  - **Use Case**: Controls response length, useful for cost management or ensuring concise outputs.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    max_output_tokens = 500
    ```

- **`metadata: Optional[Metadata] | NotGiven`**
  - **Purpose**: Attaches key-value pairs to the response for additional context or querying.
  - **Type**: `Metadata` (likely a dictionary with keys and values as strings, with length limits of 64 and 512 characters, respectively).
  - **Use Case**: Useful for tagging responses for later retrieval or analysis.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    metadata = {"request_id": "abc123", "category": "technical_query"}
    ```

- **`parallel_tool_calls: Optional[bool] | NotGiven`**
  - **Purpose**: Determines whether the model can execute tool calls in parallel.
  - **Type**: A boolean.
  - **Use Case**: Improves performance for multi-tool workflows by enabling concurrent execution.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    parallel_tool_calls = True
    ```

- **`previous_response_id: Optional[str] | NotGiven`**
  - **Purpose**: References a previous response ID to maintain conversation state in multi-turn interactions.
  - **Type**: A string (likely a UUID or similar identifier).
  - **Use Case**: Enables conversational AI by linking responses in a thread.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    previous_response_id = "resp_12345"
    ```

- **`reasoning: Optional[Reasoning] | NotGiven`**
  - **Purpose**: Configures reasoning behavior for o-series models (e.g., models designed for complex problem-solving).
  - **Type**: `Reasoning` (a custom type or configuration object).
  - **Use Case**: Enhances model reasoning capabilities, such as step-by-step problem-solving.
  - **Example**:
    ```python

  - **Purpose**: Controls whether the response is streamed (using server-sent events) or returned as a complete object.
  - **Type**: A boolean literal (`True` or `False`).
  - **Use Case**: Streaming is ideal for real-time applications or large responses, while non-streaming is suitable for smaller, immediate responses.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    stream = True  # Enable streaming
    ```

- **`temperature: Optional[float] | NotGiven`**
  - **Purpose**: Controls the randomness of the modelâ€™s output, with values between 0 and 2.
  - **Type**: A float.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Higher values (e.g., 0.8) increase randomness, leading to more creative outputs.
    - Lower values (e.g., 0.2) produce more focused and deterministic outputs.
